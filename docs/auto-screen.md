# Automatic screen sleep

From the home menu open Settings → Automatic screen sleep. Choose Always on,
30 seconds, 1 minute (default), 2 minutes or 5 minutes with Up/Down. OK saves
the selection across restarts. Long OK opens the usual return chooser; leaving
without confirming preserves the previous choice. This preference applies to
all pages, independently of whether XiaoZhi background wake is enabled.

Listening, thinking and speaking keep the screen awake. Waiting for a local
wake word does not. A recognized wake word opens XiaoZhi and wakes the display.
When the screen is asleep, the first physical button gesture only wakes it;
the next gesture operates the current page. Reminders also wake the screen.
Screen sleep does not pause radio or soundboard playback.

The shell alone controls the panel, backlight, LVGL and display performance
leases. The exclusive audio worker holds separate performance leases, suspends
the codec and both I2S channels after 15 silent seconds, and restores performance
and audio before playback. Leaving an audio app suspends audio immediately.
Being on a mini-app page no longer blocks light sleep by itself. Boot also
suspends the codec before the first playback.

Version 2.6.26 uses MAX modem sleep in silent screen-off standby while retaining
the Wi-Fi connection. Playback and conversation restore responsive networking.
Enabled voice wake continues sampling and detection, retaining its performance
requirements; it cannot achieve microphone-off standby power. Automatic wooden
fish strikes, radio and sound playback continue with the screen off. Silent
screen-off wooden fish and soundboard tasks poll less and skip unused UI work.

The read-only USB `info` response exposes screen/audio sleep and application
performance leases in `power`, plus the configured Wi-Fi mode in
`wifi.powerSave`. Reading it does not wake the display. This is not a current
measurement. USB connection protection prevents automatic light sleep while a
computer remains connected, preserving serial configuration. Measure battery
standby current with the computer disconnected; an enabled setup hotspot also
has different power requirements from station-only standby.

The saved choice uses `screen_timeout` in `cyber_badge_v1` NVS. Missing or invalid
values fall back to one minute without clearing existing data. Saving failure
retains the prior active preference and leaves the selection page open.

Validation: `tests/test_badge_power.c` covers choices and deadline arithmetic;
`tests/test_badge_power_runtime.c` exercises the real power coordinator with
stubbed time/display/audio (including wake retry, owner handoff and microphone
restore); `tests/test_badge_navigation.c` covers selection, save and cancel.
